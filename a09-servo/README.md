Video [a09-servo](https://youtu.be/IlVX7E-KEmY?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr&t=5s) Get a 6V servo working. Never run a 6V servo off the photon. It may work for a few seconds but my students have fried too many photons doing that. Servo's are very easy to use, make sure you change the code to prove you understand how it works. The servos we use tend to messup around 0 degrees and at 180 degrees, We find it works best to go from 10 degrees to 170 degrees. Challenge: How to get the servo working with the web-app?
