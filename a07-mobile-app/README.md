#How to change your Web-App.html into a full fledge Android App

Video [A07-mobile-App](https://youtu.be/nR8pwlmnSJU?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr&t=5s). Once you have a working web page you can then convert the web page into a free Android App (or IOS App but for $100 per year to Apple !) The App can then be installed on your android. All of this is done very easily using the online Adobe [Phonegap Build](https://build.phonegap.com)


The only difference between this folder and a06-web-app folder is that the wap-app.html file must replace the index.html file in your forked version of this github repository. Then use https://build.phonegap.com to create the Android app.
