	TLDR; Wil Wheaton's Law

	This sketch will attempt to identify a previously enrolled fingerprint.

/* Hardware setup - FPS connected to Photon using JST SH Jumper 4 Wire Assembly (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10359)
	If the JST SH jumper wires were numbered left to right as 1-4 (with black wire being Wire 2), the connections would be:	
	FPS Wire 1 (Red) = VCC --> Photon 3.3V
	FPS Wire 2 (Black) = GND --> Photon GND
	FPS Wire 3 (Yellow) = RX --> Photon TX
	FPS Wire 4 (Green) = TX --> Photon RX
	
	Built-in green LED on FPS will light up if wiring is correct
