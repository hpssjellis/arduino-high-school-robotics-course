Video [a04-SOS-programming](https://youtu.be/ZnaCcftdiR0?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr&t=5s) A short look at programming the particle.io photon by having students control the D7 LED to flash SOS



This code is not for the Portenta H7 as it as LED_Builtin connected to 3V3 making the High and Low reversed. LOW turns the LED on, weird.
