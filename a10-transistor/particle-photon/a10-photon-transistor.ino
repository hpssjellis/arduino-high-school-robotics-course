// Transistors can protect the Photon from hgiher voltages and currents 
//while still allowing the Photon to control the Higher Power circuit.

// In a PNP Transistor he large Voltage and Current circuit connects it's Ground to the to Emitter (P)
// In a PNP transistor the proton Ground (GND) goes to the BASE (N)
// And both circuits connect their Positives (Pins on the Photon) to the Collector (P)

// Trick here, the middle letter is always what the Photon connects to. 
// PNP transistor the Photon connects ground wich is negative 
// NPN photon connects pins which are positive.
