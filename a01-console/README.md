Basic console program 


I changed a01-arduino-console.ino to be the absolute basic program for showing the console, and printing whatever is at A0 Analog Pin.
A0 can give a range of numbers from 0 - 4095. The code works even if nothing is connected at pin A0.

particle-photon/random-integer.ino is the one in the video
Video [a01-console:](https://youtu.be/chaqZgd_6Vs?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr&t=5s)  A simple console program to get things started. No webpage needed. Outputs a counter, a random number and the analog sensor A0 to the console, by using a GND (black), 3V3 (red) , SIG (yellow) sensor connected to A0 in this case a [slide potentiometer](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Slide-Potentiometer-p-1196.html) (variable resistor).
