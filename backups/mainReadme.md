# particle.io-photon-high-school-robotics
Most of the important files from my High School Robotics course using the particle.io photon a wifi out of the box arduino.


For advanced students in my High School beginner robotics class to proceed quickly through the course so they can start making prototypes or for beginner students in my advanced Robotics Construction class to go at their own pace through some of the harder assignments.

Hopefully this repository will stay reasonably static so that it matches the video series at

1. [a06-web-app](https://youtu.be/NocvWycfz2o?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr) A web page replacement for the Tinker App. You can edit the web page to look and control any pins on the Photon. View the generic working web app at [https://hpssjellis.github.io/particle.io-photon-high-school-robotics/](https://hpssjellis.github.io/particle.io-photon-high-school-robotics/)

1. [A07-mobile-App](https://youtu.be/nR8pwlmnSJU?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr). Once you have a working web page you can then convert the web page into a Free Android (or IOS for $100 per year !) That can be installed on your android phone using [Phonegap Build](https://build.phonegap.com)

1. [A08-IFTTT](https://youtu.be/DOlYkTn84Bs?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr) Have your Photon control other devices on the web using https://ifttt.com. Today we just use a button to turn on D7 but using IFTTT


1. [a09-servo](https://youtu.be/IlVX7E-KEmY?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr) Get a 6V servo working. Never run a 6V servo off the photon. It may work for a few seconds but my students have fried too many photons doing that. Challenge: How to get the servo working with the web-app? 

1. [a10-transistor](https://youtu.be/S6xwStw-t1U?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr). Using a PNP transistor to protect the Photon while controlling a more powerful circuit

1. [a11-DC-motor-drivers](https://youtu.be/-LZL-XpIsHs?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr) For DC motors I would like you to use the web-app.ino and web-app.html to control both the [dual motor driver](https://www.pololu.com/product/713) to 13.5 V max and 1.2 Amp Max and the [big motor driver](https://www.pololu.com/product/1451) To 24V Max and 12 Amp Max . I have included some check programs to make sure your connections are working.

1. [a12-stepper-motor-driver](https://youtu.be/7wl20CeagmU?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr) Just proving that a [Pololu stepper motor](https://www.pololu.com/product/1204) with [Pololu stepper driver](https://www.pololu.com/product/2134) works. You should try to program it to do more fancy things.

1. [a13-arduino](https://youtu.be/VYskWeBI9Os?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr). When Wifi is bad make your Photon switch between Photon normal behaviour and Non-Wifi Arduino normal behaviour.

1. [a14-serial-I2C](https://youtu.be/oGOPE2gaRtE?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr)  using the [Groove OLED](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-OLED-Display-0.96%26quot%3B-p-781.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwuITNBRBFEiwA9N9YEF94ToMEP2Km6hlBt4COL7mtPW3P8zrbwAyTHhaB_6V2FNqwhNl2GxoCxYQQAvD_BwE) Showing how to make words print out on a very small display.

1. [The IoT rant](https://youtu.be/1ZYcCXPAMPo?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr) When I first started researching Roboitcs for the classroom I looked into what other teachers were doing with Lego Mindstorms, VEX robotics, I had messed around with Stamp micro-controllers and new about Arduino's and the Raspberry Pi's. I found out about the Particle.io Photon predecessor the Spark Core and purchased it and started working with it but was really frustrated by all the weird issues surrounding learning robotics. However, as a multi-year computer programming teacher I was really impressed with the online IDE https://build.particle.io/ and the ability to flash code wirelessly since installing software into school computers has always been a frustrating route.
Website for the video [here](https://www.rocksetta.com/spark-core-photon/iot-rant/)

Enjoy the rant.

Recently I feel like making another rant about the new particle mesh devices since they don't connect with OpenThread as easily as I thought they would.
