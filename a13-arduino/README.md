Only use Wifi when Wifi is good.

This folder might be redundant for the Arduino. The problem with the Particle-Photon is that if Wifi was bad it simply did not work. The code in the particle-photon folder shows how to make a Particle Photon work more like an Arduino. LOL

Video [a13-arduino](https://youtu.be/VYskWeBI9Os?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr&t=5s). When Wifi is bad make your Photon switch between Photon normal wifi behaviour and Non-Wifi Arduino type behaviour. Solid green means the photon is working without Wifi, breathing cyan means normal Wifi mode. Note: Learn how to set the photon to [safe mode](https://community.particle.io/t/safe-mode-explained/26259)  !
