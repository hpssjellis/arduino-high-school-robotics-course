The Particle Photon has wifi out of the box and connects to a very fancy easy to use online IDE.



Video [a13-arduino](https://youtu.be/VYskWeBI9Os?list=PL57Dnr1H_egsL0r4RXPA4PY2yZhOJk5Nr&t=5s). When Wifi is bad make your Photon switch between Photon normal wifi behaviour and Non-Wifi Arduino type behaviour. Solid green means the photon is working without Wifi, breathing cyan means normal Wifi mode. Note: Learn how to set the photon to [safe mode](https://community.particle.io/t/safe-mode-explained/26259)  !








A valid complaint about the Photon is that if wifi is having a bad day then it does not work well.

This is a real probllem if your schools wifi is overloaded.

This Photon sketch gives you the best of both situations. 
Good wifi, use the photon, not so good wifi, use the Arduino mode. If Wifi improves switch back to the Photon mode.


Note: Flashing code when wifi is bad is another situation that needs software installed on your computer.
