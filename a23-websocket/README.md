New Arduino websocket being worked on at 

https://github.com/hpssjellis/arduino-simple-websocket  Hopefully we will be able to use htttp://gitpod.io with this websocket.





For the old Particle-Photon Websocket using http://repl.it then


Go to the repository at https://github.com/hpssjellis/Particle-Spark-Core-Photon-Websocket-Hack



The websocket assignment allows very fast communication between the Photon and a webpage. 

The Particle cloud takes about 1200ms to communicate

The websocket takes about 10 ms to communicate


Problem: The websocket hacks an old version of node ws which has been deprecated. Probably would be a good idea to try to update this code to a safer version of ws.
