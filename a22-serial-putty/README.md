using putty with the photon.

Hard part at school is finding the COM port. I try COM3 up to COM11 and then remember which one worked.

Open putty and chnage the top line to serial, then try different com ports


If you don't have access to the device manager enter the command prompt

cmd   or power shell

and type c:

mode

with the photon plugged in it should show the active com ports
